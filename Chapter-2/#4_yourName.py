# A while loop checks whether the name is 'your name' or not.
# Example from page: 47

name=" "

while name!="your name": #remember the colon always
    print("Please type your name:")
    name=input()
print("Thank You!") #Remember the indentation. If not indented carefully then the while loop will execute improperly.
